# 🚧 AI-TouchScreen - Development in Progress 🚧

## 🌟 Overview
AI-TouchScreen is an innovative project that transforms any screen into a **virtual touchscreen** using **hand gestures in the air**. Leveraging **computer vision, AI, and camera-based tracking**, users can interact with their system seamlessly without physical touch. This futuristic project aims to revolutionize **human-computer interaction (HCI)** by making air gestures an intuitive control method.

## 📌 Features
- ✋ **Touchless Interaction** - Control your system using hand gestures.
- 🎥 **Camera-based Tracking** - Uses real-time video processing.
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Recognition** - Machine learning models for gesture recognition.
- 🖥️ **Virtual UI Control** - Navigate, scroll, and click using hand movements.
- 🔌 **Plug & Play** - Easy setup with minimal hardware requirements.

    OS_Interaction-->User_Feedback;
```

- **Camera**: Captures real-time hand gestures.
- **Computer Vision**: Detects hand movements.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Identifies predefined gestures.
- **Action Execution**: Converts gestures into commands.
- **OS Interaction**: Controls system UI based on recognized gestures.
- **User Feedback**: Provides real-time visual/audio feedback.

## 📷 How It Works
1. 📷 **Capture Hand Gestures** via webcam.
2. 🎯 **Process the Input** using OpenCV and AI models.
3. ✋ **Recognize Gestures** using deep learning.
4. 🖥️ **Translate to System Commands** (mouse clicks, scrolling, etc.).
5. 🔄 **Real-time Feedback** for improved accuracy.
